*Concurrent*

Simple python written automation aid. It allows you to consume a large
number of files which may all have large processing times or large
memory usage and execute a program over all of them. However this
program will ensure than only 'n' files/commands will be executed at
any one point in time.

i.e. ./concurrent <num procs> "command and args>" <files....>
e.g. ./concurrent 8 "mycommand -e 100 -f %f" *.txt

NB: Note the quotes *must* exist around the command and its arguments
NB: %f is the placeholder for where you wish the file to be
intperolated in the command
